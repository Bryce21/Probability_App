#Project

This project is an application to show the probability of getting x amount of heads (successes) out of n amount of coin flips. 

#Getting started

To run this program, run app.py and go to https://127.0.0.1/8050, or whatever is said in the console.

#Dependencies

This project requires dependencies of dash, dash-html-components, dash-core-components, and plotly graph objects.
See the official documenation at https://dash.plot.ly/ for more info.

#Why I made this

For the project at my latest internship, I built an application using the same framework as this one but 
due to the nature of the project, I cannot show the code for it. So to demonstrate that I do have experience and 
knowledge of Dash I built this example program.

#Possible points of expansion

I could eventually change this from calculating the probability of flipping a coin to calculating the probability of 
a dice roll or drawing a card. I could also work on containerizing everything in Docker. I will revisit this program
when I have more time.
